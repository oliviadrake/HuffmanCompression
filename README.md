# Huffman Compression

A project where you can input a text file, and receive a compressed binary file. You can also input a compressed binary file and decompress it back to a text file.

To begin using the code, first ensure the HuffmanCompression.java file and the 2 class files, HuffmanTreeNode.class and HuffmanCompression.class are in the same folder.

Add whatever text files you wish to compress into this folder too.

Using the terminal, navigate to within that folder and run the command 'java HuffmanCompression' then follow the program instructions.
